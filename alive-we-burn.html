			<p>Alive We Burn is a collage I created for an elective in my Sophomore year. It takes inspiration from horror films about demonic possession. The class was called xStudio: Art and Text, and in it we learned about various artists that used text in their works. We explored this implementation in our own art. This class was important to me because I had the chance to explore the Fine Art side of working with text and images, rather than the commercial side that is Communication Design.</p>
