			<p>Less Better is another collage I created for the elective class xStudio: Art and Text. It was among my favorite works to create because I enjoyed altering the meaning of the message, which came from an advertisement for health insurance. It was this piece that also made me realize that I have picked up habits from graphic design that were hard to break, such as always striving for legibility.</p>
